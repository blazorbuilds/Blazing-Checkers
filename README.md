# Blazing-Checkers
A real-time checkers game built with Blazor!

This project accompanies my [Youtube Series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDDI3SGQ9K-my5amYukPF9rRfXWXu4QJa), which aims to demonstrate the full development cycle from planning to deployment. The master branch will be kept up-to-date with the video series, but feel free to check out the devel branch for a peak at what's coming next.
